# Logistics-Forecasting-Model

🚀 Excited to Share a Recent Achievement! 🚀

As a Data Analyst Team Leader at Betechnos Technology Private Limited, I had the opportunity to develop a comprehensive Logistics Forecasting Model for the next 4 months using Python. This project focused on cab data and involved generating datasets with libraries like Datetime, Random, and TimeDelta.
The process included:
Data cleaning, handling missing values, and removing outliers to enhance model performance.
Visualizing Historical Logistics Demand using line charts for better insights.
I applied various algorithms, including statsmodels, TimeSeries Forecasting, Prophet, RandomForestRegressor, and SARIMA, comparing their performance using metrics like mean_absolute_error. After extensive testing, I found that RandomForestRegressor and SARIMA Model provided the most accurate insights for our dataset.
Looking forward to applying these insights and driving more data-driven decisions in the future!
